### Developer calendar ###

In January 2014, I created a personal calendar to observe important dates in the developer world. Soon my dev team started observing them as well. As more people became interested in this calendar, I decided to put it up and take it further here on GitHub. I hope this calendar encourages and motivates all of us developers.

Hover your mouse over any blue date(displayed as a link) for a description of that date.
